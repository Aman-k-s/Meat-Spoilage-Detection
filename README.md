#Tool for Detecting Early Bacterial Growth in Food Samples 
Using Optical Sensor Analysis

#Overview
This project presents a CNN-based framework to analyze time-dependent microscopic images by extracting low-level spatial features and studying their temporal evolution. The method focuses on quantifying localized activity (dots) and background activity (dark regions) using feature maps obtained from a pretrained ResNet50 model.
The approach enables objective, quantitative comparison of microscopic structural changes over time, which are difficult to capture using traditional image processing or classical machine learning methods.

#Tech Stack

Python
PyTorch
OpenCV
NumPy, Pandas
Matplotlib
Google Colab / Local GPU support

#Conclusion
This project demonstrates that CNN-derived low-level features, when combined with statistical normalization and time-series analysis, provide a robust and interpretable framework for studying microscopic image dynamics.
