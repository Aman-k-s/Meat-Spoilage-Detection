# **Tool for Detecting Early Bacterial Growth in Food Samples Using Optical Sensor Analysis**

---

## **Overview**
This project presents a **CNN-based framework** to analyze  microscopic images by extracting **low-level spatial features** and studying their temporal evolution. The method focuses on quantifying **localized activity (dots)** and **background activity (dark regions)** using feature maps obtained from a pretrained **ResNet50** model.

The approach enables objective, quantitative comparison of microscopic structural changes over time, which are difficult to capture using traditional image processing or classical machine learning methods.
